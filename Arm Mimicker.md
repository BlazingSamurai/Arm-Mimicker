# Arm Mimicker

This Arm Mimicker is a alternative variation of the Bluetooth Controlled DIY Arm. In this project the Robotic Manipulator is operated not via Bluetooth but with a miniature arm made up of potentiometers. When we move the miniature arm the Robotic Manipulator mimics it’s motion. This project is also a beginner’s level project wanting to explore Arduino. 

The exact DIY guide will be updated soon.
