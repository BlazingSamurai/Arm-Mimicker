# Arm Mimicker

This Arm Mimicker is an alternative variation of the Bluetooth Controlled DIY Arm. In this project, the Robotic Manipulator is operated not via Bluetooth but with a miniature arm made up of potentiometers. When we move the miniature arm, the Robotic Manipulator mimics its motion. This project is also a beginnerâ€™s level project wanting to explore Arduino. 

The exact DIY guide will be updated soon.
